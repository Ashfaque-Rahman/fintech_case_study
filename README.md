## Landscape:

* Mogo specializes in Financial Services providing support and solutions to its consumers with the variety of its innovative financial product line

* The major innovations that have been for the last 5 years in Financial Services is mostly aggressive digtization of services in order to provide more superior and quickest customer service to its consumers. The organizations arenow more focused on having digital presence of their products and services rather than opening traditional brick and mortar store. Also collaboration of new FinTeh companies and traditional banks are a very positive changes in this sector. With this collaboration, banks can now focus on their tradional banking systems leaving the repsponsibilty of their digital services and footprints to their FinTech partners allowing consumers to experience unique blend of all in all fiancial services. These trends are rshaping the financial services industry by building more personalized experience to its customer base resulting growth of good brand value, market share and significant retention of customer loyalty.

## Results

* With the end quarter result of 2020, Mogo declares revnue of approximately $44 million which is less than their 2019's revenue due to Covid-19 pandemic.

* Some coore metrics that comapnies in Financial services use to measure it's success are Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, Working Capital, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Leverage, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Inventory Turnover etc. 

* As per some current analysis, Mogo's growth will bemore than double in terms of revenue and share prices in 2022. Although some are saying that company is not performing as per management's commitment but due to recent analysis, the company is predicted to come back strongly in 2022 due to it's recent acuistion of Carta Worldwide.

## Recommendations

* inn my opionion, with the recent acquistion of Carta Worldwide, a modern digtal payment solutions worldwide, Mogo can focus building strong blockchain based platform with collaboration with Carta Worldwide technology and offer services like smart contract services to the other financial services companies

* There are some bad reviews in online about Mogo due to it's aggressive nature to give easy loans to low/bad credit holder driving some of them into bigger debts. But I believe these incidents are few. The company is helping more rather than considering this small numbers of mishappens. In order to expand their busniess not only in the lending sectors but to other promising realm, the company should take initiative like my proposal in the above, Blockchin based smart contract.
